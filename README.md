#DEV-APPS
##Portfolio for web developers

Hi guys ! This is Dev-Apps, a [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony) 4.4 application that helps developers 
(and especially those looking for a job, like me) to show the world what 
they are capable of. The application is in French as I made it for me but 
feel free to translate it !

### Prerequisites

1. Check composer is installed
2. Check yarn & node are installed

### Install

1. Clone this project
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `yarn install`

And you're good to go !
